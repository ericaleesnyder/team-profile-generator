## Description

For this team profile generator, I wanted to reinforce the test driven development and object oriented programminc concepts that are integral to this type of task. 

This command line application allows the user to generate a team profile webpage by inputting the identfiying information for each team member. The team member options were manager, engineer, and intern. 

This approach allows for a much more sophisticated application to be created with very little effort on the user's side. 

This activity allowed me to become much more comfortable with the concept of test driven development and helped inform an efficient and linear workflow. I am confident that I prevented many bugs during the process of writing the code by simply not getting ahead of myself.
